    ✨ THE MAGICAL MERLIN WISH TREE ✨

    Deep within the neon forests of the GavinNot Realm stands an ancient legend:
    <strong>The Merlin Wish Tree</strong> — a sentient fusion of nature and forgotten
    technology. Its roots run through both earth and circuitry, and its glowing
    eyes hold the memory of a thousand timelines.

    They say the Tree was once a guardian wizard who merged with the last living
    oak to protect the realm from collapse. Now, it grants wishes to those brave
    enough to approach it — but only one wish for each traveller, and only if
    their heart is true.

    When a wish is accepted, the Tree’s circuits ignite with a blue cosmic glow,
    and a swirling orb forms in its hand — the <strong>Seed of Destiny</strong>.
    Once released, the seed weaves the wish into reality through mysterious,
    unpredictable magic. Some say it has reshaped entire futures.

    Many have come. Only a few have been chosen.  
    <em>What wish will you place before the Merlin Wish Tree?</em>
